# Program Description:
This program is designed to search for recipes based on user input ingredients and cuisine type. The program interfaces with the Edamam API to retrieve recipe data and displays information about the recipes, including calorie information and ingredients. Users can also choose to save the recipe information to a JSON file for future reference.

# Running the program:
